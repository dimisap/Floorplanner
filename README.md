# Floorplanner

This is a floorplanner application.

It is built for my MSc Thesis and it's basically a tool that a Museum Manager can use to track statistics for the Museum.

You can create the floorplan of the Museum and add all the information needed (visitors, exhibits visited, minutes per exhibit and date).

After that you are able to see a heatmap of the room depending on the visits added and have important statistics, such as unique visitors, total visits, visits per 
exhibit, total unique visitors per exhibit, revisitability per exhibit, total minutes spent per exhibit and average time per exhibit.

In order for this application to run, you need to create a MySQL database with a name "tracksystem" and import the 2 SQL files (tracksystem.sql, visit.sql).
